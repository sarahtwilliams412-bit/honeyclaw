## Logo Concept: "The Digital Honeytrap"

### Primary Visual Elements

#### 1. The Honey (🍯)
- Represents the "honeypot" — the bait that attracts attackers
- Warm amber/gold color palette
- Suggests sweetness that's actually a trap
- Digital/glitchy interpretation, not literal honey jar

#### 2. The Claw (🦀/🦞/⚔️)
- Represents capture, control, defensive strength
- Could be:
  - A stylized crab/lobster claw
  - A mechanical/robotic claw
  - Abstract angular shapes suggesting grip
- Sharp, precise, technical aesthetic
- Suggests "catching" and "holding" threats

#### 3. The Fusion
The magic is combining these two opposing concepts:
- Soft + Sharp
- Sweet + Dangerous  
- Inviting + Capturing

## Visual Directions to Explore

### Direction A: "Honey Drop with Claw"
- A drop/drip of honey forming the shape of a claw at the bottom
- As if the honey is crystallizing into a sharp defensive form
- Gradient from warm gold (top) to sharper amber/orange (bottom)
- Minimal, works well at small sizes

### Direction B: "Hexagon Hive + Claw"
- Honeycomb hexagon pattern
- One hexagon transforming into a claw shape
- Represents the transition from trap to capture
- Tech/geometric feel fits cybersecurity aesthetic

### Direction C: "Bear Trap Honey Pot"
- Stylized honey pot/jar
- Bear trap jaws emerging from the top
- More literal but immediately readable
- Could be too aggressive — test variations

### Direction D: "Abstract Pincer"
- Two curved shapes meeting (like claw pincers)
- Negative space forms honey drop
- Very minimal, modern, memorable
- Works great as app icon
